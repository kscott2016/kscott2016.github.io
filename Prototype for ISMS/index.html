            <p>The Illinois State Medical Society is a professional organization that represents and unifies its physician members as they practice the science and art of medicine. The Society represents the interests of member physicians, advocates for patients and promotes the doctor/patient relationship, the ethical practice of medicine, and the betterment of the public health.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>In Springfield, Illinois, June of 1840, 12 physicians and surgeons of the State of Illinois assembled to make preliminary arrangements for the organization of the Illinois State Medical Society. These physicians were concerned with the solution of ethical, scientific, legislative and economic problems plaguing physicians. From this embryonic beginning, ISMS has grown into the leading advocate of Illinois physicians and patients. Since its inception, ISMS membership has represented the overwhelming majority of Illinois physicians statewide, from all specialties and practice types.
