            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>In Springfield, Illinois, June of 1840, 12 physicians and surgeons of the State of Illinois assembled to make preliminary arrangements for the organization of the Illinois State Medical Society. These physicians were concerned with the solution of ethical, scientific, legislative and economic problems plaguing physicians. From this embryonic beginning, ISMS has grown into the leading advocate of Illinois physicians and patients. Since its inception, ISMS membership has represented the overwhelming majority of Illinois physicians statewide, from all specialties and practice types.

                    <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, The medical profession has long subscribed to a body of ethical statements developed primarily for the benefit of the patient; and</p>
                    <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, As a member of this profession, a physician must recognize responsibility not only to patients, but also to society, to other health professionals and to self; therefore, be it</p>
                    <p><strong>RESOLVED</strong>, That the following Code of Ethics be adopted by the Illinois State Medical Society not as laws, but standards of conduct that define the essentials of honorable behavior for the physician:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>A physician shall be dedicated to providing competent medical service with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall uphold the standards of professionalism, be honest in all professional interactions, and strive to report physicians deficient in character or competence, or those who engage in fraud or deception, to appropriate entities.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall respect the law and also recognize a responsibility to seek changes in those requirements that are contrary to the best interest of the patient.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall respect the rights of patients, colleagues, and other health professionals, and shall safeguard patient confidences and privacy, within the constraints of the law.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall continue to study, apply and advance scientific knowledge, maintain commitment to medical education, make relevant information available to patients, colleagues, and the public, obtain consultation, and use the talents of other health professionals when indicated.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall, in the provision of appropriate patient care, except in emergencies, be free to choose whom to serve, with whom to associate, and the environment in which to provide medical service.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall recognize a responsibility to participate in activities contributing to an improved community and the betterment of public health.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall, while caring for a patient, regard responsibility to the patient as paramount.</li>
                    <li>A physician shall support access to medical care for all people.&nbsp;</li>
                      </ol>
                    <p>"Ethical standards are the foundation of a profession. As one profession or House of Medicine, the ISMS and AMA have identical ethical standards."</p>

                   <p><strong>House of Delegates</strong>: The ISMS House of Delegates is the forum where direction for the ISMS is determined. Once a year, members of the ISMS House of Delegates come together to debate and vote upon resolutions which will set direction for the Society. The House is comprised of members elected by each county medical society. Every ISMS member has the right to make their voice heard in a meaningful way through the democratic process and elected county delegates. Resolutions adopted by the House as official ISMS policy are implemented and overseen by the ISMS Board of Trustees.</p>
                    <p><strong>Board of Trustees</strong>: The ISMS Board of Trustees is elected by members of the House of Delegates at the Society's annual meeting. The Board is charged with carrying forward the agenda established by the House of Delegates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Member Councils and Committees</strong>: Councils and committees offer ISMS members an opportunity to become actively involved in the Society and in organized medicine at the state level. Through more than a dozen ISMS councils and committees, doctors express their views on topics affecting medicine and help direct ISMS actions.</p>
                    <p>The county medical societies are the source of nominations for ISMS council and committee posts. Many physicians first get involved in committee work at the local level.</p>

ISMS members consist of Regular members, Group members, Emeritus members, Retired members, Service members, Distinguished members, In-training members and Student members.
