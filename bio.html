                Welcome to my site! I’m a junior majoring in Computer Science with minors in Motion Pictures and Art at the University
              of Miami. I have always had an interest in creating graphic effects and creating amazing stories.
              Before I enrolled at the University of Miami, I did not have any video editing classes
              available to me. I was determined to learn more about video editing and graphic design so I taught myself.
              I’m proud to say that I’m a self-taught video editor! I have experience in  iMovie, Adobe After Effects,
              Adobe Premiere, and Avid. I have created recreational videos, videos for classes, videos for my church,
              and high school.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                At the University of Miami, I've completed Digital Production classes, Screenwriting classes, Art classes,
              and Programming classes. Outside of the classroom, I design promotional material for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.
              and the University of Miami's chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. If you ask any of my friends, they
              will tell you that I'm a huge fan of anything animated! I love animations and graphics, because they allow you to look
              at things in a completely different way and they're fun! They also allow you to immerse yourself in a world of
              vivid imagery and creativity. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides graphics and animations, I'm passionate about mentoring youth. If we want any positive changes
              in our society, we must educate all students. We cannot leave anyone behind. My ambition is to develop a game that will introduce
              young students to a wide spectrum of careers. I believe that the lack of exposure is the main reason why there is a disparity for minority representation
              in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Many of these students are only introduced to these fields at the senior high
              school or university level. If tey're not prooperly prepared for these fields, they will find them very difficult and shy away from them. The more things you
              expose yourself to, the more you're willing to explore the field. In addiotion, I believe to effectively teach children STEM subjects, they need to be
              presented in a fun way. With the completion of this project, I hope young students will not be afraid to try new things and believe any dream they have,
              can be achieved.<br>
            </p>
