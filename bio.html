                Welcome to my site! I’m a junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Motion Pictures and Art at the University
              of Miami. I always had an interest in creating graphic effects and creating amazing stories.
              Before I enrolled at the University of Miami, I did not have video editing classes
              available to me. I was determined to learn more about video editing and graphic design so I taught myself.
              I’m proud to say that I’m a self taught video editor! I have experience in  iMovie, Adobe After Effects,
              Adobe Premiere, and Avid. I created many recreational videos, videos for classes, videos for my church,
              and high school.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                At the University of Miami, I've enrolled in Digital Production classes, Screenwriting classes, Art classes,
              and Programming classes. Outside of the classroom, I design promootional material for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.
              and the University of Miami's chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. If you ask any of my friends, they
              will tell you that I'm a huge fan of anything animated! I love animations and graphics, because they allow you to look
              at things in a completely different way and they're fun! They allow others to immerse themselves in a world of
              vivid imagery and creativity. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides graphics and animations, I'm passionate about mentoring youth. Children are our future. If we want any positive change
              in our society, we have to educate children the best way we can. In the future, I plan to develop a game that will introduce
              children to try a spectrum of different careers. I believe the reason why there is disparity for minority representation in the
              STEM (Science,Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics) fields,  because they are only introduced to the difficulty of those fields
              and don't know how to properly prepare for those careers. The more things you expose yourself to, the more you're willing to explore the field. Plus I've believe
              to effectively teach children things, it needs to be presented in a fun way. With the completion of this project, I hope youth will
              not be afraid to try new things and believe any dream they have, they can achieve it.<br>
            </p>
